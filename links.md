I had a problem with my old laptop once. One day, when I tried booting in, there was an error that said "No Bootable Device". I GSGS'd my way to my solution: changing the boot mode from UEFI to Legacy. I had no idea why that happened, until today when I watched this video. It turns out my laptop's hard drive was still set to MBR therefore I couldn't boot up in UEFI mode.
